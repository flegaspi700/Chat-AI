# **App Name**: FileChat AI

## Core Features:

- **Chat Interface**: Real-time chat interface for interacting with the AI tool.
- **Multi-Source Analysis**: The AI can use content from multiple documents and websites to provide comprehensive answers.
- **File Upload**: Allows users to upload files (`.txt`, `.pdf`) to be used as a knowledge base.
- **Website Scraping**: Users can provide any website URL, and the application will scrape its content to use as a source for the chat.
- **Source Management**: A clean sidebar interface allows users to easily add, view, and remove their file and URL sources, organized into separate sections.

## Style Guidelines:

- **Primary color**: HSL 220, 70%, 50% - A deep, saturated blue (#3682CD) evokes trust, intelligence, and communication.
- **Background color**: HSL 220, 20%, 95% - A very light, desaturated blue (#F0F4F8) creates a calm and professional atmosphere.
- **Accent color**: HSL 190, 80%, 40% - A contrasting yet complementary cyan (#14A3B8) highlights interactive elements and calls to action.
- **Font pairing**: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to create a balance of modernity and readability.
- **Icons**: Simple, geometric icons for file types and common actions.
- **Layout**: Clean, organized layout with clear sections for the chat interface and the source management sidebar.

## Next Steps (Suggestions):

- **Streaming Responses**: Enhance the user experience by streaming AI responses token by token, rather than waiting for the full response to be generated.
- **Chat History**: Implement a feature to save and load past chat conversations, possibly using browser local storage.
- **User Authentication**: Add user accounts to allow individuals to save their files and chat history securely.
- **More File Types**: Expand file support to include other common formats like `.docx`, `.csv`, or even images.
- **Content Summaries**: Show a brief AI-generated summary for each uploaded file or URL to give the user a quick overview of the source material.
