## üêõ Known Issues to Watch For

1. **PDF Parsing:**
   - Large PDFs may take 10-30 seconds to process
   - Some PDFs with complex formatting may not parse correctly
   - Image-based PDFs (scanned documents) won't work without OCR

   - JavaScript-heavy sites may not load properly
   - Some sites block scrapers (403/429 errors)
   - Very large pages may timeout
   - Sites with authentication won't work

3. **Context Window:**
   - Too many sources may exceed AI context limits
   - Very long documents may be truncated
   - Combining 10+ sources may cause issues
