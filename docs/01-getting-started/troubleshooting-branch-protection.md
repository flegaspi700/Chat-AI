# 🔧 Fixing "CI Status Check Not Appearing"

## ❓ Problem

When setting up branch protection, the status check **"CI / Code Quality & Tests"** doesn't appear in the search dropdown.

---

## 🎯 Why This Happens

GitHub only shows status checks that have **run at least once** on the repository. 

**Possible reasons:**
1. CI workflow hasn't completed yet (still running)
2. CI workflow failed before completing all jobs
3. CI workflow hasn't run on the main branch yet

---

## ✅ Solution: Two Options

### **Option A: Wait for CI to Complete** (Recommended)

#### **Step 1: Check if CI is Running**
👉 **https://github.com/flegaspi700/DocuNote/actions**

Look for:
```
CI
↻ In progress
```

or

```
CI
✓ Completed
```

#### **Step 2: Wait for First Successful Run**
- If you see CI running → wait 2-3 minutes for it to complete
- If you see CI completed successfully → refresh the branch protection page

#### **Step 3: Return to Branch Protection**
👉 **https://github.com/flegaspi700/DocuNote/settings/branches**

- Click "Add branch protection rule" again
- Enter branch name: `main`
- Scroll to "Require status checks to pass before merging"
- Search for: `CI`
- It should now appear! ✅

---

### **Option B: Set Up Protection First (Without Status Check)**

You can set up branch protection NOW without the status check, then add it later.

#### **Step 1: Configure Basic Protection**

**Branch name pattern:** `main`

**Enable these (without status checks for now):**
- ✅ Require a pull request before merging
- ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
- ✅ Do not allow bypassing the above settings
- ✅ Require linear history

**Click "Create"**

#### **Step 2: Add Status Check Later**

After CI completes successfully:
1. Go back to: Settings → Branches
2. Click "Edit" on the `main` rule
3. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
4. Add "CI / Code Quality & Tests"
5. Click "Save changes"

---

## 🔍 Verify CI Has Run

### **Check Actions Tab:**
```
https://github.com/flegaspi700/DocuNote/actions
```

**You should see:**
```
✓ CI
  feat: add GitHub Actions CI workflow
  #1234567 succeeded
```

**If you see "Failed" or "Cancelled":**
- The status check won't appear
- Fix the CI issue first
- Let CI complete successfully
- Then add status check

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step: Complete Setup

### **Step 1: Verify CI Status**

Open: https://github.com/flegaspi700/DocuNote/actions

**Look for the latest workflow:**

#### **If you see: ✓ CI - Completed successfully**
→ Good! Go to Step 2

#### **If you see: ↻ CI - In progress**
→ Wait 2-3 minutes, then refresh and go to Step 2

#### **If you see: ✗ CI - Failed**
→ We need to fix the CI first before adding protection

---

### **Step 2: Set Up Branch Protection**

#### **If CI has completed at least once:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/flegaspi700/DocuNote/settings/branches
2. Click "Add branch protection rule"
3. Branch name: `main`
4. Enable:
   - ✅ Require a pull request before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
     - ✅ Require branches to be up to date
     - Search: `CI` → Select: **"CI / Code Quality & Tests"** ← Should appear now!
   - ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
   - ✅ Do not allow bypassing the above settings
5. Click "Create"

---

### **Step 3: Test It**

I can test it for you with:
```bash
echo "test" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: branch protection"
git push origin main
```

Should see:
```
❌ error: Changes must be made through a pull request
```

## 🎯 Quick Decision Tree

```
Is CI visible in Actions tab?
├─ Yes, with green checkmark ✓
│  └─ Status check should appear → Set up protection normally
│
├─ Yes, but failed ✗
│  └─ Fix CI first → Then set up protection
│
├─ Yes, but in progress ↻
│  └─ Wait 2-3 minutes → Then set up protection
│
└─ No workflows at all
   └─ Push a commit → Trigger CI → Then set up protection
```

## 💡 Alternative: Manual Status Check Name

If the dropdown still doesn't work, you can type the exact name manually:

1. In the search box under "Status checks", type exactly:
   ```
   Code Quality & Tests
   ```
   
2. Or try searching for just:
   ```
   test
   ```

3. The full job name is:
   ```
   CI / Code Quality & Tests
   ```
