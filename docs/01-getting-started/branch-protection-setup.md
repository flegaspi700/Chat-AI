# 🛡️ Setting Up Branch Protection

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Goal:** Protect the `main` branch from broken code

---

## 🎯 What is Branch Protection?

Branch protection rules prevent code from being merged into important branches (like `main`) unless certain conditions are met.

### **Without Branch Protection:**
```
You: Push broken code → Goes straight to main ❌
Team: Opens PR with failing tests → Can merge anyway ❌
Anyone: Can force push and delete history ❌
```

### **With Branch Protection:**
```
You: Push to PR → CI must pass first ✅
Team: Opens PR → Can't merge until CI passes ✅
No one: Can force push to main ✅
```

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### **Step 1: Go to Repository Settings**

1. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   https://github.com/flegaspi700/DocuNote/settings
   ```

2. Or navigate manually:
   - Go to https://github.com/flegaspi700/DocuNote
   - Click **"Settings"** tab (top right)

---

### **Step 2: Navigate to Branch Protection**

1. In the left sidebar, click **"Branches"**
2. Under "Branch protection rules", click **"Add branch protection rule"**

---

### **Step 3: Configure the Rule**

#### **Branch name pattern:**
```
main
```
Type exactly: `main` (this targets your main branch)

#### **Enable These Settings:**

##### ✅ **1. Require a pull request before merging**
**What it does:** Forces all changes to go through PRs (no direct pushes to main)

**Sub-options to enable:**
- ✅ **Require approvals:** 0 (you can set to 1 if working with a team)
- ✅ **Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed**

##### ✅ **2. Require status checks to pass before merging**
**What it does:** CI must pass before you can merge

**Sub-options to enable:**
- ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**

**Then click "Add" and search for:**
- Type: `CI` and select: **"CI / Code Quality & Tests"**
  (This is your GitHub Actions workflow)

##### ✅ **3. Require conversation resolution before merging**
**What it does:** All PR comments must be resolved

##### ✅ **4. Do not allow bypassing the above settings**
**What it does:** Even admins (you) must follow the rules

**Optional but recommended:**
- ✅ **Require linear history** (prevents messy merge commits)
- ✅ **Require deployments to succeed before merging** (if you add deployment later)

---

### **Step 4: Save**

Scroll to the bottom and click **"Create"** or **"Save changes"**

---

## 🎉 What You Just Enabled

### **Protection Level:**

```
Branch: main 🛡️

Rules:
✅ Must create pull request (no direct pushes)
✅ CI must pass before merging
✅ Branch must be up to date
✅ Conversations must be resolved
✅ No force pushes allowed
✅ No deletions allowed
```

---

## 🧪 Test It Out!

Let's verify it works by trying to push directly to main:

### **Step 1: Make a Small Change**
```powershell
# Make a test change
echo "# Test branch protection" >> README.md

# Try to commit and push directly to main
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: verify branch protection"
git push origin main
```

### **Expected Result:**
```
remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed for refs/heads/main.
remote: error: Changes must be made through a pull request.
To https://github.com/flegaspi700/DocuNote.git
 ! [remote rejected] main -> main (protected branch hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/flegaspi700/DocuNote.git'
```

**Perfect!** ✅ Branch protection is working!

## 🔄 New Workflow: How to Make Changes Now

### **Old Way (Direct Push):**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add something"
git push origin main  # ← This no longer works!
```

### **New Way (Pull Request):**

#### **Option 1: Create Branch Locally**
```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/add-something

# Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add something"

# Push to new branch
git push origin feature/add-something

# Go to GitHub and create PR
```

#### **Option 2: Use GitHub UI**
1. Go to your repository
2. Click "Code" dropdown → "New branch"
3. Make changes in browser
4. Create pull request

#### **Option 3: Use VS Code (Recommended)**
1. Click Source Control panel
2. Click "..." → "Branch" → "Create Branch"
3. Make changes
4. Commit
5. Click "Publish Branch"
6. VS Code will prompt to create PR!

## 📊 What Happens When You Create a PR

### **1. PR is Created**
```
Pull Request #1: "feat: add something"
Status: Open

Checks:
↻ CI / Code Quality & Tests — Running...
```

### **2. CI Runs Automatically**
```
↻ Type check
↻ Lint code
↻ Run tests
↻ Build application
```

### **3. After ~2-3 Minutes**

**If CI passes:**
```
✓ CI / Code Quality & Tests — Passed

✅ All checks have passed
🟢 This branch has no conflicts with the base branch
Merge pull request button is enabled
```

**If CI fails:**
```
✗ CI / Code Quality & Tests — Failed

❌ Some checks were not successful
1 failing check
Merge pull request button is DISABLED
```

### **4. Merge the PR**

Once CI passes:
1. Click **"Merge pull request"**
2. Confirm merge
3. Optionally delete the branch
4. Done! ✅

---

## 🎯 Benefits You Get

### **1. No More Broken Main Branch**
```
Before: Broken code can reach main ❌
Now:    CI catches it before merge ✅
```

### **2. Code Review Process**
```
Before: No review → straight to main ❌
Now:    Review → CI passes → merge ✅
```

### **3. Clean History**
```
Before: Direct pushes, no record ❌
Now:    Every change has a PR ✅
```

### **4. Collaboration Ready**
```
Before: No controls for team ❌
Now:    Rules enforced for everyone ✅
```

### **5. Confidence**
```
Before: "Did I break main?" 😰
Now:    "CI passed, safe to merge!" 😎
```

## 🛠️ Common Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Hotfix Needed Urgently**

You still need to create a PR, but you can:
1. Create branch: `git checkout -b hotfix/urgent-fix`
2. Fix the issue
3. Push and create PR
4. CI runs (only 2-3 minutes)
5. Merge immediately when CI passes

**Still safe!** CI validates even urgent fixes.

### **Scenario 2: Working Alone**

Even if you're the only developer:
- ✅ Forces you to run CI before merging
- ✅ Creates clear history of changes
- ✅ Good practice for future collaboration
- ✅ Prevents accidental force pushes

### **Scenario 3: CI is Taking Too Long**

If CI is slow:
- Optimize test suite (parallel execution)
- Cache dependencies (already done!)
- Skip some tests for PR (run full suite on merge)

But **never skip CI entirely!**

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After setting up, verify:

- [ ] Go to Settings → Branches

2. ✅ PRs show CI status
3. ✅ Can't merge until CI passes
4. ✅ Clear workflow for changes

---

## 🔗 Visual Guide

### **Before (No Protection):**
```
Your Code → Push → Main Branch → Done
              ↓
         (No checks!)
```

### **After (With Protection):**
```
Your Code → Branch → PR → CI Runs → Pass? → Merge → Main
                            ↓         ↓
                         (Checks)   (Yes/No)
```

## 📖 Next Steps

After branch protection is set up:

1. **Test it** - Try the workflow with a sample PR
2. **Document it** - Add PR instructions to README
3. **Add more** - Consider adding:
   - Required reviewers (if working with team)
   - CODEOWNERS file (auto-assign reviewers)
   - Status checks for E2E tests (when added)
