## Session Summary

This session focused on resolving a series of cascading bugs related to theme switching and implementing a new AI-powered theme generation feature.

### Key Activities:

1.  **Theme Bug Fixes:**
    *   Addressed multiple issues preventing the theme from switching correctly, particularly with the "Gray" and "Dark" themes.
    *   Corrected CSS selectors in `globals.css` to use `html[data-theme='...']` instead of class-based selectors (`.dark`).
    *   Fixed the `ThemeProvider` configuration in `layout.tsx` to use `attribute="data-theme"` and include all available themes in the `themes` array.
    *   Resolved an issue where the theme toggle icon (sun/moon) was not updating by directly using the `useTheme` hook to conditionally render the correct icon.
    *   All bugs and resolutions were logged in `docs/dev-issue-log.md`.

2.  **UI Refactoring:**
    *   Created a new `SettingsMenu` component in the top-right corner of the header.
    *   Moved all theme-switching functionality into this new settings dropdown menu for better UI organization.

3.  **AI Theme Generation Feature:**
    *   **Conceptualized:** Designed an approach to allow users to generate themes from a text prompt.
    *   **UI Implementation:** Added a "Generate with AI" option to the new `SettingsMenu`, which opens a dialog for the user to enter a theme prompt.
    *   **Genkit Flow:** Created a new flow (`src/ai/flows/generate-theme.ts`) that takes a user's prompt and returns a structured JSON object containing a color palette and a two-word hint for a background image.
    *   **Dynamic Application:** Implemented client-side logic in `src/components/ai-theme-generator.tsx` to:
        *   Call the Genkit flow via a server action.
        *   Dynamically create and inject a `<style>` tag into the document head with the AI-generated colors.
        *   Use `next-themes` to apply the new theme instantly.
    *   **Dynamic Backgrounds:** Extended the feature to use the `imageHint` from the AI to set a dynamic background image on the "Sources" sidebar, further enhancing the generated theme.
    *   **Bug Fixing:** Addressed an issue where subsequent AI-generated themes would not apply correctly by ensuring old, dynamically injected `<style>` tags were removed before adding new ones.
