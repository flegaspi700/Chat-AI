## üìà Tracking Progress

Daily logs help you:
- ‚úÖ Track velocity (how much gets done per day)
- ‚úÖ Identify patterns (recurring issues)
- ‚úÖ Document decisions (why we chose X over Y)
- ‚úÖ Onboard new developers (context and history)
- ‚úÖ Measure impact (before/after metrics)

---

## üéì Best Practices

1. **Be specific** - Include file names, line numbers, error messages
2. **Include context** - Why did you make this decision?
3. **Use timestamps** - When did this happen?
4. **Link resources** - Reference docs, Stack Overflow, etc.
5. **Update regularly** - Don't wait until end of day
6. **Be honest** - Document failures and learnings too
