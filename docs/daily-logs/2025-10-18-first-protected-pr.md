## 🛡️ Branch Protection Summary

### **Final Settings:**
```
Branch: main

Protection:
✅ Require pull requests
❌ Require approvals (disabled for solo work)
✅ Require status checks to pass
   ✅ Code Quality & Tests
   ✅ Branches must be up to date
✅ Require conversation resolution
❌ Allow bypassing (enabled for owner)
✅ Require linear history
```

### **What This Means:**
- ✅ Can't push directly to main
- ✅ Must use pull requests
- ✅ CI must pass before merging
- ✅ You can merge without approval (solo dev)
- ✅ Clean linear history

**Perfect setup for solo development!** 🎯
