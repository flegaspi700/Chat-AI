# Feature Documentation

## 📖 Overview

Documentation for all major features in FileChat AI.

Each feature is documented with:
- **Why** it exists (design decisions)
- **How** it's implemented (technical details)
- **What** it does (quick summary)

---

## 🗂️ Documentation Structure

For each feature, create a subfolder with these files:

```
docs/03-features/your-feature/
├── suggestions.md       # Design options explored
├── implementation.md    # Technical implementation
└── summary.md          # Quick reference
```

---

## 📚 Example: Theme Toggle Feature

See **[theme-toggle/](./theme-toggle/)** for a complete example:

- **[suggestions.md](./theme-toggle/suggestions.md)** - 4 design options analyzed
- **[implementation.md](./theme-toggle/implementation.md)** - Technical details
- **[summary.md](./theme-toggle/summary.md)** - Quick overview

This demonstrates:
✅ Thorough design exploration  
✅ Clear technical documentation  
✅ Quick reference for future developers
