```

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
- Individual functions and components
- AI flow logic
- Utility functions
- Type validation

### 2. Integration Tests
- Server actions with AI flows
- File parsing with content extraction
- URL scraping with content retrieval
- Component interactions

### 3. End-to-End Tests
- Complete user workflows
- Multi-source interactions
- Theme generation flow
- Error handling scenarios

## Testing Tools

- **Jest**: Unit and integration testing
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing
- **Playwright**: E2E testing
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: API mocking
- **Jest-DOM**: Custom matchers

## Test Coverage Goals

- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ coverage
- **Integration Tests**: 70%+ coverage
- **E2E Tests**: Critical paths covered
- **Overall**: 75%+ coverage

## Testing Environments

1. **Local Development**: Run tests during development
2. **CI/CD**: Automated testing on every commit
3. **Pre-deployment**: Full test suite before production
4. **Production Monitoring**: Synthetic tests in production

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: File Upload and Processing
**Given**: User has no sources uploaded
**When**: User uploads a .txt file
**Then**: 
- File appears in sidebar
- Content is extracted correctly
- AI can answer questions about the file

### Scenario 2: URL Scraping
**Given**: User wants to add a webpage as source
**When**: User enters a valid URL
**Then**:
- URL is scraped successfully
- Title and content are extracted
- Source appears in sidebar
- AI can use the scraped content

### Scenario 3: Multi-Source Q&A
**Given**: User has uploaded 2 files and 1 URL
**When**: User asks a question spanning multiple sources
**Then**:
- AI synthesizes information from all sources
- Response is accurate and relevant
- Sources are appropriately referenced

### Scenario 4: Error Handling
**Given**: User attempts to scrape an invalid URL
**When**: Scraping fails
**Then**:
- Error toast is displayed
- Source is not added to list
- Application remains stable

### Scenario 5: Theme Generation
**Given**: User wants a custom theme
**When**: User enters a theme prompt
**Then**:
- AI generates appropriate colors
- Theme is applied to the interface
- Theme persists during session

### Scenario 6: Source Management
**Given**: User has multiple sources
**When**: User removes a source
**Then**:
- Source is removed from list
- AI no longer uses that source
- Other sources remain intact

## Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | Target | Acceptable |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| File upload (<1MB) | <500ms | <1s |
| URL scraping | <3s | <5s |
| AI response | <5s | <10s |
| Theme generation | <3s | <5s |
| PDF parsing (<5MB) | <2s | <5s |
