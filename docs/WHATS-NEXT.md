## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

I'll organize these by priority and learning value:

---

## 🔥 **TIER 1: High Impact, Quick Wins** (1-2 hours each)

### **1. Add Branch Protection Rules** 🛡️
**Why:** Prevent broken code from reaching main  
**Learning:** GitHub repository settings, team collaboration  
**Impact:** 🔥🔥🔥 High

**Steps:**
1. Go to: Settings → Branches → Add rule
2. Branch name pattern: `main`
3. Enable:
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date
   - ✅ Status checks: CI / Code Quality & Tests
4. Save

**Outcome:** Can't merge PRs unless CI passes!

---

### **2. Add More Component Tests** 🧪
**Why:** Increase coverage from 43% to 55%+  
**Learning:** React Testing Library, component testing patterns  
**Impact:** 🔥🔥🔥 High

**Priority Files (Low Coverage):**
- `file-upload.tsx` (9.9% coverage)
- `source-card.tsx` (16.02% coverage)
- `conversation-history.tsx` (44.69% coverage)

**Steps:**
1. Create `src/__tests__/components/file-upload.test.tsx`
2. Test file validation, upload flow, error states
3. Run `npm run test:coverage` to see improvement
4. Commit and push → CI validates!

**Estimated Coverage Gain:** +10-15%

### **3. Add E2E Tests to CI** 🎭
**Why:** Test real user workflows automatically  
**Learning:** Playwright, end-to-end testing  
**Impact:** 🔥🔥 Medium-High

**Steps:**
1. Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to include Playwright
2. Install Playwright browsers in CI
3. Run E2E tests after unit tests

npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged
npx husky install
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx lint-staged"
```

**Configure in package.json:**
```json
"lint-staged": {
  "*.{ts,tsx}": [
    "eslint --fix",
    "prettier --write"
  ]
}
```

**Outcome:** Automatic linting before every commit!

### **5. Add Code Coverage Reports** 📊
**Why:** Track coverage trends over time  
**Learning:** Codecov, coverage visualization  
**Impact:** 🔥 Medium

**Steps:**
1. Sign up for Codecov.io (free for public repos)
2. Add to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
```yaml
- uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
  with:
    file: ./coverage/lcov.info
```
3. Add coverage badge to README

**Outcome:** Beautiful coverage reports and history!

---

### **6. Set Up Deployment Preview** 🔍
**Why:** See changes live before merging  
**Learning:** Firebase preview channels, PR previews  
**Impact:** 🔥🔥 Medium-High

2. Deploy to Firebase preview channel on PR
3. Comment on PR with preview URL

**Outcome:** Every PR gets a live preview link!

---

## 💡 **TIER 3: Advanced Features** (4-8 hours each)

### **7. Add Continuous Deployment** 🚢
**Why:** Auto-deploy to production when CI passes  
**Learning:** CD pipeline, Firebase deployment  
**Impact:** 🔥🔥🔥 High (but requires setup)

**Steps:**
1. Create `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`
2. Add Firebase service account secret
3. Deploy on merge to main
4. Add smoke tests after deployment

**Outcome:** Fully automated deployment!
